# afmaths

A simple package of math functions. Many of these will display output to the console to help understand what steps are required.

This project uses semantic versioning. Major versions will be breaking changes.

# Todo

- Add tests
- Create output functionality, which prints (in a user friendly way) the steps required
  - Probably remove operations file as a result
- Doc comments
